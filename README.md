Code implemented in Kays et al. 2023 Multi-scale movement syndromes for comparative analyses of animal movement patterns

## Script metadata

```daily summaries fft.R```: This script calculated distributional parameters for turning angle and step length distributions 

```daily traj fft.R```: This script implements the sinuosity and straightness indices described in Benhamou, S. (2004)

```daily traj fft resamp.R```: This script implements the sinuosity and straightness indices with different approaches to the rediscretization step length, including the mean per individual, the velocity autocorrelation timescale of each individual, and the overall mean step length across individuals

```Movement_Syndromes_metrics.R``` This script is taken and adapted from Abrahms et al. 2017, Movement Ecology DOI: 10.1186/s40462-017-0104-2 and calculated the metrics used in their paper
